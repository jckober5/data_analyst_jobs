Data Analyst - Part-Time (Contract),Origin, Anywhere ,via Glassdoor,"Description:
Do You Love Spreadsheets
...
Have you been wondering why no one seems to appreciate a good macro or the symphony of seamless databases?

Do you dream about data and the story it tells?

Are you interrupted during that first sip of coffee by a creative idea on how two streams of data can connect to become... one?

Are you trying to find that missing puzzle piece of new work that you can't quite put your finger on?

Have you even maybe worked in the health industry, with software called Dr. Chrono? (or maybe not that specifically, but you know what we mean when we say EMR)

If you've gotten this far, you might be the exact person we're looking for!

Origin is seeking a part-time, contract Data Analyst (possible opportunity to grow into a full-time role in 2024 for the right candidate).

About You

This is not your first data analyst rodeo. You're familiar with startups (ie. messy data that isn't always easy to work with), spreadsheets, gsheets, formulas, macros, databases. You've done this before. For at least 4-5 years if not longer. With an early stage company. Where nothing about the process is plug and play.

You're detail-oriented. REALLY detail oriented. You can quickly see the anomalies in a data-set after working with it just a couple of times.

You're proactive, and recognize that not everyone moves as fast as you do. You can see everything that can be fixed and improved, but also understand that they'll need to understand, that change management takes time, and that there's an end-user to receives that data that you put together (who will need to have the bandwidth to assimilate the change too).

You believe in leaving things better than you found them. You know that a few tweaks can make some drastic improvements, and are happy to do the work after making sure it's cool to do so and you have the whole picture of everything that's impacted.

If you see something, you say something. Often, in the process of collecting, looking at and verifying data, you identify things that are not, technically, your problem. And maybe not even a problem. But better to say something and make sure that there isn't a double charge or double booking, or things were meant to be that way.

You're not afraid of the old school manual stuff either. Sometimes we're not in control of all of the technology and reports we need, and must resort to the tried and true manual work. And you're ok with that.

• Gathering Data - Whether an analyst collects the data themselves or coordinates with others in the organization, there needs to be efficient processes in place to... compile data. Data might come from tracking tools like Google Analytics, company surveys, email marketing software, or any number of sources. In the healthcare space, analysts use patient records, clinical trial data, data from insurance claims, and other pieces of information to improve patient care and health outcomes. Using algorithms and other tools, healthcare professionals can plan and execute the right decisions faster and save lives. Hospitals and other healthcare institutions also use data to plan ahead for important purchases like personal protective equipment (PPE) and reduce supply shortages.
• Designing and Maintaining Databases - Many data analysts need to establish processes for storing, retrieving and categorizing data, as well as address any structural issues or coding errors within databases. Depending on the role, they might work on this individually, or collaborate with an engineer.
• Cleaning Data - Although not the most glamorous part of the role, data must be cleaned of duplicates, errors, and unnecessary information. This can be done manually, but often involves using automated software or programming.
• Using Tools to Interpret Data - Statistical programs are an important part of any analyst's toolbox. Data analysts use software like SAS and Excel or programming languages like Python to discover patterns and insights and make sense of large amounts of data.
• Documenting and Improving Processes - Data analysts work with others in the organization, such as engineers and business leaders, to create data policies, improve data collection and develop thorough documentation.
• Presenting to Stakeholders - Data doesn’t mean much if it doesn’t lead to meaningful action or business decisions. Data analysts format and visualize data to make it easier to understand, and present their findings to key stakeholders.
