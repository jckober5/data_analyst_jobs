After graduating Brigham Young University in 2017 with a degree in Statisitics I have pursued a career in Data Analytics.  In 2020 to continue my pursuit, I graduated from Southern New Hampshire University with a degree in Data Analysis.  I've worked in several smaller companies performing data analysis tasks and have moved into a career now where I feel comfortable and knowledgeable in this field. 

As I look to my future and what my goals are for the future I've been tasked with the question on what do I need to build upon to grow in my career.  One example is what do I need to accomplish to become a Senior in my field.  

The primary objective of this project I've done is to evaluate the distinct skill sets and experiences that differentiate a Senior Data Analyst from a Data Analyst. By examining various facets such as technical proficiencies and experience levels, I aim to construct a unique view of the skill and experience needed towards seniority in data analysis roles.

With this project I have gathered Data Analyst job postings from Google using SerpAPI and Python.  After that I've been able to model and format the data within a view in SQL so that it can be easily read and used within Tableau.  Here I want to perform a simple, but powerful analysis on the followingâ€¦

What programming language is in larger demand? (R vs Python vs SQL)

What BI platform is in larger demand? (Tableau vs Power BI vs Looker)

What are the qualifications to be hired as a Senior Data Analyst?

Required Skills 

The project aims to provide a robust comparative analysis of the skills and experiences necessary for transitioning from a Data Analyst to a Senior Data Analyst. The outcomes will serve as a valuable guide for aspiring data professionals, like myself, seeking to structure career development paths in the realm of data analysis. Ultimately, this project will contribute to a better understanding of the evolving career path for Data Analysis and the critical factors that underpin career progression in this dynamic field.
