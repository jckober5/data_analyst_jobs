# data_analyst_jobs
I graduated Southern New Hampshire University with a Masterâ€™s Degree in Data Analytics in 2020. In this analysis I wanted to show all the different types of jobs in the USA that require the skills I gained in my Major. The data I gathered was from 2019 which is the year prior to my graduation. Showing where I would have to look to find the most jobs in my field as well as the top recruiting sites for Data Analysts.

I published this data from www.data.world where they gathered Indeed job posting data from sources such as Jobspikr. This dataset was created by the in house teams from PromptCloud and DataStock.

I was excited to see the different job offerings around the country for someone with my skillsets!
